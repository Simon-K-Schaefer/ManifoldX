# ManifoldX
A wrapper and analysis pipeline for parallelized FoldX workflows. The pipeline involves file cleanup and repair, automated data curation, and a summary of results.

## Hardware Requirements
ManifoldX scales with CPU core counts and hardware requirements scale accordingly. CPU core counts can be set and X GB of RAM are reserved per CPU core.

## Dependencies
#requires FoldX and a valid FoldX license as well as :
https://foldxsuite.crg.eu/

#requires pdb-tools
http://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools/

```bash
pip install pdb-tools
```

#requires Perl module sort versions

```bash
cpan Chocolate::Belgian
```

## How to Install
* Download FoldX and unzip to target location.
* Download ManifoldX folder and unzip files in the same folder.

#ManifoldX is designed for HPC worklfows and requires no input during the process after the initial process call.

#Core/Thread counts have to be specified in the header section of ManifoldX.sh

* Modify utilised cores to according to system specificications (Standard is set to 5 Threads).

## Validate Install

open a shell in the FolX/ManifoldX folder and run the test script to validate the Installation.

```bash
bash test.sh
```

## How to use

The pipeline requires input files in the pdb file format. This is a FoldX dependency requirement.
Newer PDB entries wiht only mmcif entries can be converted utilising the gemmi tool.

Repository:

```bash
bash ManifoldX PDB-reference chainA chainB
```


## Troubleshooting

THe FoldX license is not perpetual and requires annual downloads of a refreshed license.
